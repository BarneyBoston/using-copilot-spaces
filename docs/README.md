# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome! This README introduces the OctoAcme project management processes and provides quick links to all detailed process docs. Whether you're new to the team or a seasoned contributor, this central resource will help you navigate our approach to delivering customer value through structured, iterative project execution.

## Project Management Summary

OctoAcme follows a five-phase project lifecycle designed to deliver customer value predictably and sustainably: **Initiation**, **Planning**, **Execution**, **Release**, and **Retrospective**. Each project begins by validating business needs and establishing clear success metrics with stakeholder alignment. During planning, teams create actionable backlogs, estimate effort, identify dependencies, and finalize timelines and risk mitigation strategies. This ensures every team member understands what success looks like and what their role is in achieving it.

Execution revolves around iterative delivery, where teams break work into small, testable increments that can be continuously integrated and reviewed. Daily standups keep everyone aligned on progress and blockers, while weekly syncs provide space for deeper collaboration between Project Managers, Product Managers, and Developers. Pull requests follow strict quality standards—small changesets, automated testing, code reviews, and security scanning—to maintain high quality and reduce deployment risk. Regular demos and milestone reviews ensure that stakeholder feedback is incorporated early and often.

Our collaborative model emphasizes clear ownership and communication. **Project Managers** coordinate delivery schedules, manage risks, and maintain transparency through consistent status updates. **Product Managers** define outcomes, prioritize the backlog based on customer and business value, and measure impact through data-informed decisions. **Developers** implement features, contribute to design discussions, and uphold quality through testing and code reviews. Communication is frequent and purposeful: daily standups, weekly team syncs, monthly stakeholder updates, and clear escalation paths ensure that everyone stays informed and empowered to act.

Quality assurance is woven throughout the entire lifecycle. Teams follow rigorous PR workflows, maintain comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, and end-to-end), and leverage automated CI pipelines for testing and security scanning. Release management includes coordinated deployment checklists, smoke tests, rollback plans, and incident response playbooks. After each release, retrospectives capture lessons learned and generate action items for continuous improvement. This emphasis on iterative, data-informed delivery and a culture of psychological safety enables OctoAcme teams to ship confidently, learn quickly, and continuously raise the bar.

## Core Stages at a Glance

1. **Initiation:** Clarify need, outcomes, and stakeholder alignment — validate the business case, define success metrics, and secure go-ahead for planning ([Project Initiation Guide](./octoacme-project-initiation.md))

2. **Planning:** Create actionable backlogs, estimate effort, finalize timeline and risks — break down work into manageable increments, identify dependencies, and establish delivery milestones ([Project Planning Guide](./octoacme-project-planning.md))

3. **Execution & Tracking:** Daily/weekly team rhythms, PR standards, demo/review, and progress tracking — deliver iteratively with continuous integration, code reviews, and regular stakeholder demos ([Execution & Tracking](./octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md))

4. **Release & Deployment:** Coordinated releases, deployment checklists, rollback/incident playbook — ensure quality through pre-release checks, smoke tests, and clear rollback procedures ([Release & Deployment Guide](./octoacme-release-and-deployment.md))

5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement:** Action items and lessons learned — reflect on what went well and what can improve, then implement changes for the next iteration ([Retrospective & Continuous Improvement](./octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md))

6. **Risks & Communication:** Tracking risks, clear updates, and escalation paths — maintain a risk register, provide transparent status updates, and escalate blockers appropriately ([Risk Management & Communication](./octoacme-risks-and-communication.md))

7. **Roles & Personas:** Typical responsibilities — understand the key roles (Project Managers, Product Managers, Developers) and their collaboration model ([Roles & Personas](./octoacme-roles-and-personas.md))
